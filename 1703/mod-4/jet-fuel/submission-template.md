Yes

# Code Quality

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you are proud of
[happy code](https://github.com/coleworsley/jet-fuel/blob/master/db/test/seeds/testSeeds.js#L55-L60)

I was particularly proud of this piece of code as it greatly simplified the idea of importing seeds into a database. By rewriting the code from the lesson in my own style, I was able to gain a much better understanding of the purpose of seeding databases especially for testing

#### Link to a specific block of your code on Github that you feel not great about
[sad code](https://github.com/coleworsley/jet-fuel/blob/master/public/index.js#L67-L83)

Based on the way I set up my elements, I had to make a couple nasty jquery functions that became hard to follow. I think going forward, I want to do my best to create more modularized code.

#### Attach a screenshot or paste the output from your terminal of the result of your test-suite running.

Fun project! Everything was pretty straightforward and clearly explained. It was definitely weird working with jQuery after using react for so long!
